## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure and Technical Analysis

The project adheres to professional standards by strictly separating content (`index.html`) from styling (`css/kasper.css`).

### 1. File Breakdown (Function of Specific Code Parts):

| File Name | Primary Role in the Project | Key Professional Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`index.html`** | **Structural Blueprint:** Defines the entire flow and content of the one-page layout (Header, Services, Portfolio, etc.). | **Semantic HTML5** for better SEO and code readability. |
| **`normalize.css`** | **Consistency Guarantee:** Resets default browser styling differences to ensure a uniform appearance. | Essential for **Cross-Browser Compatibility**. |
| **`all.min.css`** | **Icon Library:** Provides all the scalable vector icons for service sections and the navigation bar (via **Font Awesome**). | Efficiently loads icons using the **minified** version for faster performance. |
| **`kasper.css`** | **Core Design and Layout:** Contains all custom styling rules, colors, typography, and responsive adjustments. | Demonstrates strong use of **Flexbox/Grid**, **CSS Pseudo-elements** for unique design accents. |

### 2. Design and CSS Highlights (Detailed Explanation):

* **Modular Layout:** The entire site uses a **multi-section structure**, allowing easy isolation and maintenance of individual components (e.g., the Portfolio filtering section or the Testimonials area).
* **Pure CSS Mastery:** The project showcases advanced CSS techniques, including **media queries** for full responsiveness and using **Grid/Flexbox** for complex arrangements like the service boxes and image gallery.
* **Minimalist Aesthetic:** The styling emphasizes white space, clear typography, and a distinct primary color, adhering to modern minimalist design principles.
